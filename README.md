### Setup Development Environment
```bash
pip install pipenv
pipenv install
pipenv shell
```
You might need to use `python3 -m` before `pipenv` in some cases. 

### Run Code
```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

### Installing modules
Before installing modules, use `exit` command to exit the shell, then run the following:
```
pipenv install <module>
```
then use `pipenv shell` to activate the shell back again. This will add the required modules to the Pipfile as well.
